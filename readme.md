# OntoAnon Test Data

This is the test data set for the [OntoAnon](https://github.com/Uni-Rostock-Win/OntoAnon/) Application. The initial commit contains the original ontologies, the second commit is then anonymized. The following ontologies are used:

- [Biogeographic Area Ontology](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/biorealm)
- [The FoodOn Ontology](https://github.com/FoodOntology/foodon)
- [The Bio Attribute Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/bio-attribute-ontology)
- [The UK Parliament Ontology](https://github.com/ukparliament/Ontology/blob/master/Ontology.ttl)
- [The Software Ontology](https://github.com/allysonlister/swo)


OntoAnon was tested using the HTTP://neontometrics.com service. The metric results can be retrieved on NEOntometrics. To do so, type the URL of the git-repo into the calculation engine field and select the metrics to be compared.
