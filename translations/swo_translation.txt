The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. 

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. 

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. 

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.   => Object36

An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other. => Object158

This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing. => Object247

This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.

To define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:

 * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? 
 * Is the causal relation regulatory?
 * Is the influence positive or negative?

The first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.

For the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.

For the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.

Each of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types. => Object613

This property, together with 'uses software', is probably best modelled as a child of has_part. Its current position in the property hierarchy is based on simplicity of use.

BFO 2 Reference: In all areas of empirical inquiry we encounter general terms of two sorts. First are general terms which refer to universals or types:animaltuberculosissurgical procedurediseaseSecond, are general terms used to refer to groups of entities which instantiate a given universal but do not correspond to the extension of any subuniversal of that universal because there is nothing intrinsic to the entities in question by virtue of which they – and only they – are counted as belonging to the given group. Examples are: animal purchased by the Emperortuberculosis diagnosed on a Wednesdaysurgical procedure performed on a patient from Stockholmperson identified as candidate for clinical trial #2056-555person who is signatory of Form 656-PPVpainting by Leonardo da VinciSuch terms, which represent what are called ‘specializations’ in [81 => Object1113
Entity doesn't have a closure axiom because the subclasses don't necessarily exhaust all possibilites. For example Werner Ceusters 'portions of reality' include 4 sorts, entities (as BFO construes them), universals, configurations, and relations.

BFO 2 Reference: Continuant entities are entities which can be sliced to yield parts only along the spatial dimension, yielding for example the parts of your table which we call its legs, its top, its nails. ‘My desk stretches from the window to the door.

BFO 2 Reference: every occurrent that is not a temporal or spatiotemporal region is s-dependent on some independent continuant that is not a spatial region => Object1153
BFO 2 Reference: s-dependence obtains between every process and its participants in the sense that, as a matter of necessity, this process could not have existed unless these or those participants existed also. A process may have a succession of participants at different phases of its unfolding. Thus there may be different players on the field at different times during the course of a football game; but the process which is the entire game s-depends_on all of these players nonetheless. Some temporal parts of this process will s-depend_on on only some of the players. => Object1154
Occurrent doesn't have a closure axiom because the subclasses don't necessarily exhaust all possibilites. An example would be the sum of a process and the process boundary of another process. => Object1155
Simons uses different terminology for relations of occurrents to regions: Denote the spatio-temporal location of a given occurrent e by 'spn[e]' and call this region its span. We may say an occurrent is at its span, in any larger region, and covers any smaller region. Now suppose we have fixed a frame of reference so that we can speak not merely of spatio-temporal but also of spatial regions (places) and temporal regions (times). The spread of an occurrent, (relative to a frame of reference) is the space it exactly occupies, and its spell is likewise the time it exactly occupies. We write 'spr[e]' and `spl[e]' respectively for the spread and spell of e, omitting mention of the frame. => Object1156

BFO 2 Reference: The realm of occurrents is less pervasively marked by the presence of natural units than is the case in the realm of independent continuants. Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war) => Object1203

BFO 2 Reference: One major family of examples of non-rigid universals involves roles, and ontologies developed for corresponding administrative purposes may consist entirely of representatives of entities of this sort.

(These terms are all, in the jargon of philosophy, phase sortals.) By using role terms in definitions, we can create a BFO conformant treatment of such entities drawing on the fact that, while an instance of professor may be simultaneously an instance of trade union member, no instance of the type professor role is also (at any time) an instance of the type trade union member role (any more than any instance of the type color is at any time an instance of the type length).If an ontology of employment positions should be defined in terms of roles following the above pattern, this enables the ontology to do justice to the fact that individuals instantiate the corresponding universals –  professor, sergeant, nurse – only during certain phases in their lives. => Object1286

A molecular process that can be carried out by the action of a single macromolecular machine, usually via direct physical interactions with other molecular entities. Function in this sense denotes an action, or activity, that a gene product (or a complex) performs. These actions are described from two distinct but related perspectives: (1) biochemical activity, and (2) role as a component in a larger system/process. => Object1346

Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex. => Object1349

A biological process represents a specific objective that the organism is genetically programmed to achieve. Biological processes are often described by their outcome or ending state, e.g., the biological process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells (a divided cell) from a single parent cell. A biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence. => Object1353

2014-03-31: In the example of usage ("In the protocol of a ChIP assay the objective specification says to identify protein and DNA interaction") there is a protocol which is the ChIP assay protocol. In addition to being concretized on paper, the protocol can be concretized as a realizable entity, such as a plan that inheres in a person. The objective specification is the part that says that some protein and DNA interactions are identified. This is a specification of a process endpoint: the boundary in the process before which they are not identified and after which they are. During the realization of the plan, the goal is to get to the point of having the interactions, and participants in the realization of the plan try to do that. => Object1390

'Plan' includes a future direction sense. That can be problematic if plans are changed during their execution. There are however implicit contingencies for protocols that an agent has in his mind that can be considered part of the plan, even if the agent didn't have them in mind before. Therefore, a planned process can diverge from what the agent would have said the plan was before executing it, by adjusting to problems encountered during execution (e.g. choosing another reagent with equivalent properties, if the originally planned one has run out.) => Object1666
We are only considering successfully completed planned processes. A plan may be modified, and details added during execution.

An entity that can bear roles, has members, and has a set of organization rules. Members of organizations are either organizations themselves or individual people. Members can bear specific organization member roles that are determined in the organization rules. The organization rules also determine how decisions are made on behalf of the organization by the organization members. => Object1749
BP: The definition summarizes long email discussions on the OBI developer, roles, biomaterial and denrie branches. It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:

1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch
editor), with individual persons as bearers

2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)

3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles
there are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the
charter/rules/bylaws themselves.

It is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent
continuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the
bearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define
organization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to
all kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.

Interestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place
organization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,
Government Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,
W3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.

This leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -
3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its
current place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to
'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue
for now. => Object1750

k-means clustering => Object2077
A k-means clustering is a data transformation which achieves a class discovery or partitioning objective, which takes as input a collection of objects (represented as points in multidimensional space) and which partitions them into a specified number k of clusters. The algorithm attempts to find the centers of natural clusters in the data. The most common form of the algorithm starts by partitioning the input points into k initial sets, either at random or using some heuristic data. It then calculates the mean point, or centroid, of each set. It constructs a new partition by associating each point with the closest centroid. Then the centroids are recalculated for the new clusters, and the algorithm repeated by alternate applications of these two steps until convergence, which is obtained when the points no longer switch clusters (or alternatively centroids are no longer changed). => Object2078

The second URI is stored within swo_algorithms.owl and is an import from OntoDM (OntoDM_170075). As the SWO class contains no annotation beyond its label, and because OntoDM has more structure surrounding its algorithm classes, the OntoDM class was retained and the SWO class was deemed obsolete.

The free Segway software package contains a novel method for analyzing multiple tracks of functional genomics data. Our method uses a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model, which enables it to analyze the entire genome at 1-bp resolution even in the face of heterogeneous patterns of missing data. This method is the first application of DBN techniques to genome-scale data and the first genomic segmentation method designed for use with the maximum resolution data available from ChIP-seq experiments without downsampling. => Object4588

GlobalAncova approach: After appropriate normalisation, gene-expression-data appear rather symmetrical and outliers are no real problem, so least squares should be rather robust. ANCOVA with interaction yields saturated data modelling e.g. different means per group and gene. Covariate adjustment can help to correct for possible selection bias. Variance homogeneity and uncorrelated residuals cannot be expected. Application of ordinary least squares gives unbiased, but no longer optimal estimates (Gauss-Markov-Aitken). Therefore, using the classical F-test is inappropriate, due to correlation. The test statistic however mirrors deviations from the null hypothesis. In combination with a permutation approach, empirical significance levels can be approximated. Alternatively, an approximation yields asymptotic p-values. => Object5085

Classical multivariate analysis-of-variance tests perform poorly in cases with several highly correlated responses and the tests collapse when the number of responses exceeds the number of observations. This paper presents a new method which handles this problem. The dimensionality of the data is reduced by using principal component decompositions and the final tests are still based on the classical test statistics and their distributions. The methodology is illustrated with an example from the production of sausages with responses from near infrared reflectance spectroscopy. A closely related method for testing relationships in uniresponse regression with collinear explanatory variables is also presented. The new test, which is called the 50-50 F-test, uses the first k components to calculate SSMODEL. The next d components are not involved in SSERROR and they are called buffer components. => Object6302

cosmo searches a set of unaligned DNA sequences for a shared motif that may, for example, represent a common transcription factor binding site. The algorithm is similar to MEME, but also allows the user to specify a set of constraints that the position weight matrix of the unknown motif must satisfy. Such constraints may include bounds on the information content across certain regions of the unknown motif, for example, and can often be formulated on the basis of prior knowledge about the structure of the transcription factor in question. The unknown motif width, the distribution of motif occurrences (OOPS, ZOOPS, or TCM), as well as the appropriate constraint set can be selected data-adaptively. => Object6933

Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm is an algorithm which generates a statistically correct trajectory (possible solution) of a stochastic equation. It can be used to simulate chemical or biochemical systems of reactions efficiently and accurately using limited computational power. The algorithm is particularly useful for simulating reactions within cells where the number of reagents typically number in the tens of molecules (or less). Mathematically, it is a variety of a dynamic Monte Carlo method and similar to the kinetic Monte Carlo methods. It is used heavily in computational systems biology => Object10198

Monte Carlo is a discrete stochastic simulation algorithm and an estimation procedure algorithm. If it is necessary to know the average value of some random variable and its distribution can not be stated, and if it is possible to take samples from the distribution, we can estimate it by taking the samples, independently, and averaging them. If there are sufficiently enough samples, then the law of large numbers says the average must be close to the true value. The central limit theorem says that the average has a Gaussian distribution around the true value. => Object10201

A licensed is a free license according to GNU if the users have the four essential freedoms:

    The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
    The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
    The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
    The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

A program is free software if users have all of these freedoms. Thus, you should be free to redistribute copies, either with or without modifications, either gratis or charging a fee for distribution, to anyone anywhere. Being free to do these things means (among other things) that you do not have to ask or pay for permission to do so.

“Free software” does not mean “noncommercial”. A free program must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution. Commercial development of free software is no longer unusual; such free commercial software is very important. You may have paid money to get copies of free software, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies.  => Object10565

Copyleft is a derivative code same license clause which says that anyone who redistributes the software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and change it. In other words, it requires that all derivative code uses the same license, but further limits the type of license to one which gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program's code, or any program derived from it, but only if the distribution terms are unchanged. To copyleft a program, you first state that it is copyrighted; then the distribution terms described above are added. This makes copyleft a legal instrument ensuring that the code and the freedoms become legally inseparable. => Object10600

Purchase cost is a license clause which states whether there is a cost involved with a particular usage or licensing of a resource. => Object10696
In some ways, purchase cost is similar to the already-extant usage clause hierarchy, which includes restricted and unrestricted usage. However, a usage limitation is not necessarily due to whether or not something costs money: even if the usage is academic only, it could still be either free or non-free. A license could have multiple usage clauses, e.g. academic only when free, and unrestricted if a fee is paid. Purchase cost was created which, together with a usage clause, defines both limitations and cost. => Object10697

CC BY-NC-SA 2.5 is a nonfree license, as there are restrictions on charging money for copies. You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. This license also lets others build upon the original work for non-commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. The GNU Project does not recommend that you use this license for documentation. In addition, it has a drawback for any sort of work: when a modified version has many authors, in practice getting permission for commercial use from all of them would become infeasible.

The ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence is a document intended to allow you to freely share, modify, and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions. This licence is intended for use on databases or their contents (“data”), either together or individually. The goal is to eliminate restrictions held by the original creator of the data and database on the use of it by others. Rightsholders will not be able to “dual license” their work by releasing the same work under different licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they choose. Rightsholders therefore can’t re-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license.  => Object11179

This is the original BSD license, modified by removal of the advertising clause. It is a lax, permissive non-copyleft free software license, compatible with the GNU GPL.

This license is sometimes referred to as the 3-clause BSD license.

According to the GNU Project, the modified BSD license is not bad, as lax permissive licenses go, though the Apache 2.0 license is preferable. However, it is risky to recommend use of “the BSD license”, even for special cases such as small programs, because confusion could easily occur and lead to use of the flawed original BSD license. To avoid this risk, you can suggest the X11 license instead. The X11 license and the modified BSD license are more or less equivalent.

According to the GNU project, the Apache 2.0 license is better for substantial programs, since it prevents patent treachery. => Object11183

This license states those certain conditions under which a work published under its terms may be copied, distributed, and modified. Unlike other open source licenses, the DSL was intended to be used on any type of copyrightable work, including documentation and source code. It was the first "generalized copyleft" license. This is a free and copyleft license meant for general data. THe GNU Project does not recommend it for software or documentation, since it is incompatible with the GNU GPL and with the GNU FDL; however, they consider it appropriate for other kinds of data. The DSL was written by Michael Stutz. The DSL came out in the 1990s, before the formation of the Creative Commons. According to Wikipedia, once the Creative Commons arrived, Stutz considered the DSL experiment "over" and no longer recommended its use. => Object11550

The Modified BSD is a software license based on he original FreeBSD license, modified by removal of the advertising clause. It is a lax, permissive non-copyleft free software license, compatible with the GNU GPL.

This license is sometimes referred to as the 3-clause BSD license.

According to the GNU Project, the modified BSD license is not bad, as lax permissive licenses go, though the Apache 2.0 license is preferable. However, it is risky to recommend use of “the BSD license”, even for special cases such as small programs, because confusion could easily occur and lead to use of the flawed original BSD license. To avoid this risk, you can suggest the X11 license instead. The X11 license and the modified BSD license are more or less equivalent.

Estimating the (Joint) Probability Distribution. A set of data (of type
T) is often assumed to be a sample taken from a population according to a
probability distribution. A probability distribution/density function assigns a
non-negative probability/density to each object of type T. Probably the most
general data mining task (Hand et al. 2001) is the task of estimating the (joint)
probability distribution D over type T from a set of data items or a sample
drawn from that distribution.
As mentioned above, in the most typical case we would have T = Tuple(T1,
. . ., Tk), where each of T1, . . ., Tk is Boolean, Discrete(S) or Real. We talk about
the joint probability distribution to emphasize the difference to the marginal
distributions of each of the variables of type T1, . . ., Tk: the joint distribution
captures the interactions among the variables.
Representing multi-variate distributions is a non-trivial task. Two approaches
are commonly used in data mining. In the density-based clustering paradigm,
mixtures of multi-variate Gaussian distributions are typically considered (Hand
et al. 2001). Probabilistic graphical models, most notably Bayesian networks,
represent graphically the (in)dependencies between the variables: Learning their
structure and parameters is an important approach to the problem of estimating
the joint probability distribution. => Object11748
probability distribution estimation task => Object11749
the task of pattern discovery is to find all local patterns from a given
pattern language that satisfy the required conditions. A prototypical instantiation
of this task is the task of finding frequent itemsets (sets of items, such as
{bread, butter}), which are often found together in a transaction (e.g., a market
basket) (Aggrawal et al 1993). The condition that a pattern (itemset) has to
satisfy in this case is to appear in (hold true for) a sufficiently high proportion
(called support and denoted by s) of the transactions in the input dataset.
With the increasing interest in mining complex data, mining frequent patterns
is also considered for structured data. We can thus talk about mining frequent
subsequences or mining frequent subgraphs in sequence or graph data. We can
consider as frequency the multiple occurrences of a pattern in a single data
structure (e.g., sequence or graph) or the single occurrences of a pattern in
multiple data structures. => Object11750

A predictive model M for types Td, Tc specifies a function that takes an object of type Td and returns one of type Tc, i.e., has the signature m :: Td → Tc. Most often, predictive modelling is concerned with classification, where Tc would be Boolean (for binary classification) or Discrete(S) (for multi-class classification), or regression, where Tc would be Real. In our case, we allow both Td (description) and Tc (class/target) to be arbitrarily complex data types. => Object11760
Predictive model specification is a single generalization specification and denotes a type of generalization that represents a mapping taking objects of type Td and returns objects of type To. => Object11761

Learning a (Probabilistic) Predictive Model. In this task, we are given
a dataset that consists of examples of the form (d, c), where each d is of type
Td and each c is of type Tc. We will refer to d as the description and c as the
class or target. To learn a predictive model means to find a mapping from the
description to the target, m :: Td → Tc, that fits the data closely. This means
that the observed target values and the target values predicted by the model,
i.e., c and ˆc = m(d), have to match closely. => Object11763

Clustering. Clustering in general is concerned with grouping objects into classes
of similar objects (Kaufman and Rousseeuw 1990). Given a set of examples (object
descriptions), the task of clustering is to partition these examples into subsets,
called clusters. => Object11766

A probability distribution D on type T specifies a mapping from objects of type T to non-negative Reals, i.e., has the signature d :: T → R0+. For uncountably infinite types, probability densities are used instead. The sum of all probabilities (the integral of the probability densities) over T is constrained to amount to one. => Object11768
A probability distribution specification is a single generalization specification and denotes a type of generalization that is a mapping from objects of type T to non-negative reals. This generalization is an output of a probability distribution estimation algorithm. => Object11769
